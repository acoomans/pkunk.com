[Pkunk.com](http://pkunk.com), a website made for fun, in tribute to one of the best games of the 90's: [Star Control 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control_II) (now open sourced as [The Ur-Quan Masters](http://sc2.sourceforge.net/))

It shows a Pkunk, and a random welcoming message while playing the pkunk music. Clicking on the Pkunk will make him become angry, entering "battle mode" with the famous Pkunk insults.

I know this project is completely random, just did it for fun.

Note: there are some issues with music/sound on some browsers
